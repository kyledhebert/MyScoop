Track your favorite ice cream using Scrapy and Django

## Project Goals
 - Scrape the flavors of ice cream available at a local ice cream shop using Scrapy
 - Create a web app using Django that allows users to:
  - choose their favorite flavors
  - be notified when their favorites are available
  - see the last time a flavor was available
  - write reviews of flavors
  - get flavor recomendations
